## Attachment Form M
1. choose context - attach to form M or customer
    (what other contexts are possible? LC?)


# Form M App
1.
    - Add customer
    - Add branch - create branch
    - Add customer ID
    - Add list of RMs - another directive
2. Display additional form M details
    - upload all form M details from single window
    (well not all - just the relevant ones - how do you know which
    are relevant?)
3. Display customer details including RM
4. Display form M details
5. Display LC details
6. In form M details app - separate bid, issues and covers from main form M
7. When we leave a tab and revisit it (form M list/detail/bid list) - make
    it so that when we return to the tab, we get the data we were working
    working with previously. Currently, if I am on form m detail tab and
    I navigate to say bid list tab, when I revisit form M tab, all my form M
    data would have disappeared and then I will have to re-fetch the form M.
    I think this is a waste if users time.

        on attachments and files
